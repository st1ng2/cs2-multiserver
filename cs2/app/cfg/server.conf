#
#  SECTION 1: BASIC SERVER DATA
#
###############################


#~~~~ The IP Address and port to bind the server to.
#~~~~ NOTE: IP="0.0.0.0" binds to all available Network interfaces
__IP__="0.0.0.0"
__PORT__="27015"


#~~~~ WAN_IP: The public-facing IP address, in case your server is behind a NAT
# __WAN_IP__=""


#~~~~ IP and Port for this server to be advertised in the server browser. You
#~~~~ should also change these if your server is behind a NAT
# __HOSTIP__="10.20.30.40"
# __HOSTPORT__="1337"


#~~~~ Server Password
# __PASS__="secret"


#~~~~ RCON: Enable and set password
# USE_RCON="-usercon"
# __RCON_PASS__="correcthorsebatterystaple"


#~~~~ SV_PURE: 1 = Clients with non-matching files will be kicked
#~~~~          2 = Clients are required to come from steam
#~~~~ This may cause certain mods to fail / be unusable
SV_PURE=1


#~~~~ SV_CHEATS: Enables several commands that seriously impact gameplay
SV_CHEATS=0



#
# SECTION 2: GAMEMODE AND SERVER INFO
#
#####################################


#~~~~ PRESET: Selects the gamemode to be played on this instance
#~~~~         (to be precise: this decides what preset file is loaded)
__PRESET__="competitive"


#~~~~ HOST: The organization that hosts/manages the server
#~~~~       This is just added to the server title and tags
# __HOST__="MSM"


#~~~~ Server graphics: custom images displayed to spectators and below the scoreboard
#~~~~                  Images must be placed directly in the game/csgo directory of your
#~~~~                  instance, be in PNG format and have a size of less than 16KB
#~~~~ SV_SPONSOR_IMAGE: a 360x60 image displayed on the bottom of the screen
#~~~~ SV_HOST_IMAGE:    a 220x45 image displayed on the right side, above the T player names
# SV_SPONSOR_IMAGE="sponsors.png"
# SV_HOST_IMAGE="host.png"


#~~~~ CPU_AFFINITY: Bind the server process to specific CPU cores using taskset
#~~~~               This can improve performance by reducing context switching and
#~~~~               improving CPU cache locality. Useful for high-performance servers
#~~~~               or when running multiple server instances on the same machine.
#~~~~               Leave commented out to use all available CPU cores.
#~~~~
#~~~~ EXAMPLES:
#~~~~   "0-3"     = Use CPU cores 0 through 3 (4 cores total)
#~~~~   "0,1,2,3" = Same as above, but with comma notation
#~~~~   "4-7"     = Use cores 4-7 (leaves cores 0-3 for other processes)
#~~~~   "1"       = Pin to single core
#~~~~
#~~~~ NOTE: Core numbering starts at 0. Check available cores with: nproc --all
#~~~~       Requires 'taskset' command (usually in util-linux package)
# __CPU_AFFINITY__="0-3"


#~~~~ title: A function to generate the server title. This is executed
#~~~~        after the default values have been applied
declare -f title >/dev/null || \
title () {
	echo "${HOST+"[$HOST] "}${PRESET^} CS2 server << powered by cs2-multiserver"
}

#~~~~ tags:  A function to generate the tags (comma-separated). This is
#~~~~        executed after the default values have been applied
declare -f tags  >/dev/null || \
tags  () {
	echo "${HOST,,},$PRESET,$MAP,msm,$ADDITIONAL_TAGS"
}
